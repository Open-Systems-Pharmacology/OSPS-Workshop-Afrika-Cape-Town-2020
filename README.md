# OSP Suite Workshop Cape Town postponed to February 2021
Open source PBPK modelling with the OSPSuite (PK-Sim® & MoBi®) for MIDD

# Workshop target audience
Scientists/ Pharmacometricians interested in physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK) modelling and interested in learning how to consider age dependency, predict drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and conduct population simulations in PK-Sim® & MoBi®.

# Workshop sponsors
Sponsored by Pharmetheus and co-hosted by Pharmacometrics Africa, NPC

# Workshop faculty
* Erik Sjögren, Pharmetheus, Uppsala, Sweden
* Tobias Kanacher, Pharmetheus, Hagnau, Germany

# Workshop overview
The workshop will feature PBPK modelling with the Open Systems Pharmacology suite (OSPS) also known as PK-Sim® and MoBi®. The goals are:
* Getting an introduction to the open source PBPK software PK-Sim® & MoBi® and it’s use for small molecule for investigations in clinical drug development.
* Learn how to do age dependent extrapolation with PBPK models (very young or very old populations).
* Learn how to model complex DDIs.

The combination of use cases based on published examples and hands-on lectures will enable the participants to build their own PBPK projects and maximise their impact by integrating physiological and mechanistic knowledge with preclinical and clinical information. 

While the workshop is aimed for beginners with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for advanced users.

# Workshop Learning Objectives
During the workshop, the participants will have the opportunity to become familiar with the software in extensive hands-on sessions, which will follow a brief introduction to the basic concepts of PBPK. The participants will have a chance to experience the stepwise PBPK model development and qualification. First, a base PBPK model is built and compared to observed data. Then the model is refined and through a question-based approach strategy further aspects for model extrapolation are explored. Next, the use of PBPK modelling for development of a DDI strategy is shown. We will teach you how to use and integrate pre-existing models and building blocks to create a whole-body PBPK model for complex DDIs (e.g. simultaneous induction and inhibition by a perpetrator) and optimise study protocols. Finally, a workflow is presented on how PBPK models can extrapolate beyond tested scenarios like scaling form adult populations to young, old and very old.
